<!-- ## About me -->
Hi! I am a final year undergraduate student of B.Tech. Computer Engineering at Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi. I'm presently working on my Bachelors Major Thesis on Music Generation from Brain Scans under [Prof. Tanvir Ahmad](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=y7YNRzoAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} where I'm exploring how to leverage Meta's [MusicGen](https://musicgen.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, a conditional music LLM, for brain scans.

I'm currently also a part-time researcher at the [HCTL Lab, TU Munich](https://www.edu.sot.tum.de/en/hctl/home/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} led by [Prof. Dr. Enkelejda Kasneci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bZVkVvoAAAAJ){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I'm supervised by [Yao Rong](https://yaorong0921.github.io/homepage/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on the topic of self-supervised learning for scanpaths. I was a full-time summer research intern at TUM in 2023  funded by  [DAAD-WISE Scholarship](https://www.daad.in/en/find-funding/scholarship-database/?type=a&q=&status=1&subject=F&onlydaad=1&detail_to_show=0&target=4&origin=4&pg=1&detail_to_show=50015295){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Previously, I've been a summer research intern at IIIT Allahabad under [Prof. Anupam Agarwal](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=mVXjhhgAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} where I worked on ASD diagnosis based on visual attention. I was mentored on my first research [paper](https://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jce/papers/Vol25-issue1/Ser-1/E2501013749.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on wild scene text localization in images by [Hitesh Hinduja](https://hitesh-hinduja.mystrikingly.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

I've had the honor of leading my team sCUDA_Divers to the Grand Finales of [Smart India Hackathon](https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2023){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for consecutive years of 2022 and 2023. Our hackathon project on the Super-Resolution of Digital Elevation Models culminated in a research paper published in [IEEE IGARSS 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10283196){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Recently, as part of my Bachelors Minor Thesis, I explored GNNs, LLMs, and RAG techniques for the research competition of Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations, a [SemEval 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04798){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} Task. (_paper accepted into conference!_)

I'm interested in exploring multimodal LLMs with a specific focus towards the modality of brain scans. Currently exploring [Neural Decoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_decoding){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I would love to work on projects on the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence to further our understanding of the brain and intelligence.

Tackled reconstruction of music listened by a subject based on their fMRI scans. Using [Nakai et al's dataset](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34917714/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of 5 subjects' fMRI scans while listening to 540 music pieces. Modified Meta's [MusicGen](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/musicgen.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} model for music generation conditioned on fMRI scans using the Map Method. Experimented with EnCodec, Chromagram Tokenizer, and T5 encoders, achieving the best performance using the T5 encoder with total averaging (FAD: 8.41, KL: 2.42, MCD: 4.87).

**Real-time Indoor Video Dehazing using Knowledge Distillation**\
*Smart India Hackathon Grand Finale, 2023* \
\[[Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_YyKU8hJbUSRMd9U_3KBGM3byju15JR9/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\] \[[Solution Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aWfAYDyxl2WXu0YaAbVPJdc2giFlot6J/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\]\
We proposed to modify MAPNet, a UNET-based dehazing network for outdoor environments by replacing some of the blocks with TAM-Net, a 2D convolutional variant for videos. We experimented with distillation by creating a smaller student network for dehazing. During the hackathon, we experimented with Dark Channel Prior and Boundary Contrainst Regularization approaches for benchmarking. \

**Self-Supervised Learning for Free-Viewing Scanpaths**\
*DAAD-WISE Research Project at TU Munich, 2023*\
\[[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17F_fqesKFqedVg6sIdlgmOhkPmw0T2909jU3WfDWfX0/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\] \[[Code](https://github.com/m-abbas-ansari/SSSL){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\]\
Eye movements can serve as a proxy for extracting neurological states of a subject. Our goal was to improve classifcation of a subject's cognitive characteristics based on their free-viewing scanpaths on images. We experimented with using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning technique based on BarlowTwins where we implemented novel scanpath distortion techniques to create multiple views of scanpaths. A combined  dataset was created using multiple publicly availble free-viewing scanpath datasets. Experiments demonstrated improvements in the downstream task of Autism detection.\
