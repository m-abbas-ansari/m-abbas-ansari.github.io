Hi! I am a final year undergraduate student of B.Tech. Computer Engineering at Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi. I'm presently working on my Bachelors Major Thesis on Music Generation from Brain Scans under [Prof. Tanvir Ahmad](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=y7YNRzoAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I'm currently also a part-time undergrad researcher at the [HCTL Lab, Technical Uinversity of Munich](https://www.edu.sot.tum.de/en/hctl/home/) supervised by [Yao Rong](https://yaorong0921.github.io/homepage/), where I've been a fullt-time summer research intern in 2023 under [Prof. Dr. Enkelejda Kasneci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bZVkVvoAAAAJ) funded by  [DAAD-WISE Scholarship](https://www.daad.in/en/find-funding/scholarship-database/?type=a&q=&status=1&subject=F&onlydaad=1&detail_to_show=0&target=4&origin=4&pg=1&detail_to_show=50015295). My research work at TUM involves investigating self-supervised learning techniques for scanpath datasets. Previously, I've been a summer research intern at IIIT Allahabad under [Prof. Anupam Agarwal](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=mVXjhhgAAAAJ&hl=en) where I worked on ASD diagnosis of subjects based on their fixation patterns on images. I was mentored on my first research [paper](https://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jce/papers/Vol25-issue1/Ser-1/E2501013749.pdf) on wild scene text localization in images by [Hitesh Hinduja](https://hitesh-hinduja.mystrikingly.com/). 

I've had the honour of leading my team sCUDA_Divers to the Grand Finales of [Smart India Hackathon](https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2023) for consecutive years of [2022](assets/img/sih2022.png) and [2023](assets/img/sih2023.jpg). Our hackathon project on Super-Resolution of Digital Elevation Models culiminated to a research paper published in [IEEE IGARSS 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10283196).

Recently, as part of my Bachelors Minor Thesis, I explored GNNs, LLMs and RAG techniques for the research competition of Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations, a [SemEval 2024](https://nustm.github.io/SemEval-2024_ECAC/) Task. (_paper in progress!_)

My current research interests lie in the intersection of neuroscience and artifical intelligence. I want to build systems that can decode the cognitive activity of individuals with least amount of invasive hardware. To essentially achieve mind reading using deep learning techniques.
